# Among Us - Discord Bot

A Discord Bot for making it easy to host an Among Us event without any annoying talking.

# How it workes

You have hosts for the event which can send a Game Code to a text channel an automaticly mute everone during the game by simply muting themself. <br />

You just need to take a look at the channel for the admins to see how it works (it's really not comlicated)

To see how to set up the config, look in the Wiki

# System Requirements

You don't need a beefy computer or so, you just need to have Python 3 installed and a somewhat decent internet connection. You may also host it on platforms like Heroku, but I won't go in detail on how that works.

# License
